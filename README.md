# Peer Drop - P2P Mesh Offline Communication (Flutter)

Peer Drop is an **offline, peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh communication system** . It enables devices to discover each other and communicate reliably without the need for the internet or centralized servers.

This project focuses on creating a **resilient, reliable, and secure mesh network over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth**, empowering offline communication even in **disconnected or disaster-prone environments**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üîó **P2P Mesh Network:** Devices form a local mesh and relay messages reliably.
- üì∂ **Offline-first:** Fully functional without internet using local Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.
- üì° **Device Discovery:** Auto-discovers nearby devices.
- üîí **Secure & Encrypted Communication:** Ensures privacy using encryption.
- üìÅ **File & Message Transfer:** Supports text messages, files, and media.
- üîÑ **Reliable Delivery:** Implements store-and-forward mechanisms for offline nodes.
- üåê **Cross-platform Flutter App:** Works on Android, iOS, Desktop (WIP).



## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android/iOS device or emulator
- Nearby devices on the same local network or Bluetooth enabled

### ‚úî Key Flow:

1. **Device Discovery**

   * Uses Bluetooth/Wi-Fi P2P APIs.
   * Creates dynamic peer lists.

2. **Connection Establishment**

   * Establishes P2P channels (WebRTC DataChannel or Bluetooth Socket).
   * Encrypts sessions.

3. **Message/File Handling**

   * Messages are packaged and sent over the mesh.
   * If direct delivery fails, nodes **store and forward** later.

4. **Mesh Management**

   * Routing logic ensures messages/files take the best route.
   * Nodes act as relays if needed.

5. **Offline Resilience**

   * If any node goes offline, others continue the mesh.
   * Queues pending messages until the recipient is reachable.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohansnishad/Peer-Drop.git
   cd Peer-Drop
   ````

2. Get dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```


### Notes

* Ensure devices are on the same Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth is enabled.
* Permissions for location, storage, and Bluetooth might be required.
